The AI confirmed it would work on changing the background to dark brown once the user\u2019s preferences were clarified. Additionally, the user was offered a list of features they might want to implement, which included enabling a theme toggle switch, integrating a 'Preview Changes' feature, and allowing user profile customization for preferred background settings, among other options, with some features already checked off as implemented.",
